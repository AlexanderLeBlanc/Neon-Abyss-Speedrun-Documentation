# Neon-Abyss-Speedrun-Documentation

This repository is meant to act as a guide for runners of the game Neon-Abyss. Documentation will be created here to assist in learning, developing, and keeping record of all run categories. Each category's strategy and guide documentation will be located in a file named after the category. There will also be files created dedicated to lists of boss strategies, glitches/exploits, and statistics. Please feel free to make contributions to the documentation through the creation of new pull requests. All run technology and documentation will be accredited to the original poster, as such please include your preferred username or anonymous when making additions.

**__Please include version numbers before all listings to ensure consistency.__**
**__Please include any screenshots or videos of strategies, glitches, etc. you can provide.__**
