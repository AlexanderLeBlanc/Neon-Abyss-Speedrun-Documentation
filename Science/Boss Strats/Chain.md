# Chain Strats

Chain is a boss who's first phase can be easily manipulated. Chain has two attacks, a bullet hell attack where they throw bombs at the player, and a claw attack where they swipe at the player.
It is possible to avoid the hard to dodge bullet hell by simply moving close to Chain, and then running away repeatedly, baiting out the claw attack over and over.
