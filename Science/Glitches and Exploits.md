# Glitches and Exploits

* **Sung Quick Kill: Confirmed up until version 1.4.2.5**
    This glitch seems to occur as the result of both boss position and amount of damage caused in Sung's first phase.
    As a result of the glitch occuring, Sung's first phase hitbox will appear during his second phase, allowing him to be killed very fast.

* **McFamily Phase Skip: Confirmed up until version 1.4.2.11RC**
    This glitch/exploit is possible if you manage to tick multiple members of the McFamily to 0hp at the same time during phase 1. As a result of this,
    all 0hp McFamily members will die, and the healing from the second phase will be reduced, enabling a quick kill. This has yet to be confirmed with more than 2 McFamily members at once.
